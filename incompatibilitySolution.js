To solve this, you need to check the compatibility of the library you are using with your React Native version.  You can check this by reading the documentation for the library or by checking the library's package.json file. If the library is not compatible, you will need to either downgrade your React Native version to a version that supports the library or find a compatible alternative library.  Here's an example demonstrating conditional rendering to avoid errors if a feature is not yet available:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [featureAvailable, setFeatureAvailable] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the feature is available
    const isFeatureAvailable = () => {
      // Your feature detection logic here
      // ...
      return true; // or false
    };

    setFeatureAvailable(isFeatureAvailable());
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {featureAvailable ? (
        <Text>Feature is available!</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>Feature is not available yet. Using fallback...</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

//Use this pattern in your component to add robust error handling
export default MyComponent; 
```
