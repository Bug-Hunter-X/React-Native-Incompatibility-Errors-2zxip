# React Native Incompatibility Errors

This repository demonstrates common incompatibility errors in React Native and provides solutions for resolving them.  These errors often arise from using libraries or features that clash with your current React Native version.

## Common Causes

* **Library Version Mismatch:** Using a library incompatible with your React Native version.
* **Unsupported Features:** Attempting to use features not yet implemented in your React Native version.

## How to Reproduce (incompatibilityBug.js)

The `incompatibilityBug.js` file showcases scenarios that lead to incompatibility errors.  Experiment with different React Native versions and libraries to observe these errors in practice. 

## Solutions (incompatibilitySolution.js)

The `incompatibilitySolution.js` provides solutions to the errors, including:

* **Downgrading/Upgrading React Native:** Adjusting your React Native version to match supported library versions.
* **Using Alternative Libraries:** Switching to libraries compatible with your React Native version.
* **Feature Detection:** Implementing conditional logic to check for feature support and provide alternative behavior.
